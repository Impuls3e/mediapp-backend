# mediapp

Backend for the MediApp project, supporting the frontend of a simple social media application where users can post, like, and comment on content. Built with Node.js and Express, this server-side application handles user authentication, data storage, and communication with the database. It provides RESTful APIs to manage posts, likes, and comments, ensuring smooth integration with the frontend and a seamless user experience.

Getting Started with MediApp Backend
This project is powered by Node.js and Express, serving as the backend for the MediApp social media application.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Starts the server in development mode.
The server will be available at http://localhost:5000.

The server will automatically restart when you make changes to the code.

npm test
Runs the test suite for the backend.
Check the test output to ensure everything is working as expected.

npm run build
Builds the app for production, optimizing the server for deployment.

The build will include the necessary configurations and minified files to ensure optimal performance for production.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you are not satisfied with the default configurations, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all the configuration files (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. After ejecting, you must manage all the configurations manually.

You generally do not need to eject unless you require custom configuration.
